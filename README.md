# Santa's Christmas Challenge

Use all your creativity to build a Santa, with only HTML and CSS.
Start writing your code in the `app.tsx` -> `main` element.

There are a couple of styling solutions preinstalled

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
- raw css (import as shown in the `main.tsx`)

The colors used in the final result are setup as css variables in the `index.css`

## Result
